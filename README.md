# OnboardSplit
A machine learning model to split customers at the onboarding stage

# Context
__Buckesque__ is a fake neobank servicing a niche market. They face a challenge because their onboarding process contains several manual steps. As a result they have an extensive backlog. It is noticed that a number of new customers drop out of the process because of the delay. In the long term the company will fix the onboarding process. However, in the short term the data science team are tasked with helping to classify customers in the onboarding queue. Their goal is to identify which customers have the highest potential profitability using only onboarding information. 

# Summary
Utilising a modified version of my [DataGen](https://github.com/jsmiles/DataGen) script I built a fake dataset to represent the onboarding data of __Buckesque's__ existing customer base. I have used to this data to train a machine learning model to grapple with the above problem.
